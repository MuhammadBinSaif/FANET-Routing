# A Novel Improved ArtiÔ¨Åcial Bee Colony and Blockchain-Based Secure Clustering Routing Scheme for FANET 
Flying Ad hoc Network (FANET) has drawn significant consideration from industry and researchers with its
rapid advancements and extensive use in civil and military
applications. However, due to high mobility, its limited resources
and distributed nature have posed a new challenge to develop
a secure and efficient routing scheme for FANET. In this paper,
a novel cluster based secure routing scheme is proposed, which
aims to solve routing data security problem of FANET. To ensure
the security, the optimal cluster head selection is studied based
on an objective function with objectives, i) maximize residual
energy, ii) maximize online time, iii) maximize reputation, iv)
maximize transactions, v) minimize mobility, and vi) maximize
connectivity, which exploits the fast and efficient improved ABC
(IABC). The proposed IABC with two different search equations
for employee bee and onlooker bee, retains fast convergence rate
and maintains a balance between exploration and exploitation
abilities. Further, a lightweight blockchain consensus algorithm,
namely, AI-Proof of Witness Consensus Algorithm (AI-PoW), is
introduced, in which we utilize IABC for the election of super
mining node. The concept of witness for block verification is
also involved to make the proposed scheme resource efficient
and highly resilient against 51% attack. Extensive experiments
are conducted with various network scenarios by comparing
the proposed solution with other meta-heuristic based routing
schemes. The results show that proposed scheme is superior in
terms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, throughput, and
block processing time.
